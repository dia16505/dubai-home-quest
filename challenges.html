  <h2>Challenges Faced by New Families</h2>
  <ul>
    <p>It can be rather difficult for new families to search for a decent house in the UAE. They are usually operating in a very complex environment of real estate which makes it difficult to pinpoint where they need to begin. All the following reasons explain why people who rent houses have issues when it comes to interacting with landlords: Parents go for safer estates, estates with good schools for their children, but marking such estates may not be an easy exercise. It is not easy to understand about the lease agreements and there restrictions, moreover the budget limitations makes people to compromise on the type of house they are able to get. Also, the amount of stock is also restricted as well as problems in establishing facilities pressure the businessmen. It is also stressful to have to accommodate to new surroundings and having to form new social circles. Knowledge of these factors is in turn useful in the search for a home by any family.
